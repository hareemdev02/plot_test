## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the erlang and elixir version installed as specified in the `.tool-versions` file. If you use the [asdf Version Manager](https://asdf-vm.com/), install asdf core and then you can simply run `asdf install erlang` and `asdf install elixir`.

  * Run `asdf install` to install the erlang and elixir versions from asdf.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
